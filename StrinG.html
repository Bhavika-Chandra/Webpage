<article class="all">
<p>The guitar is a fretted musical instrument that typically has six strings. It is usually held flat against the player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while simultaneously pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum or individual finger picks may also be used to strike the strings.</p> 
<h3>There are three main types of modern guitar:-</h3>
<p><ol type="I"><li>The classical guitar (Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar).</li>
<li>The steel-string acoustic guitar or electric guitar.</li>
<li>The Hawaiian guitar.</li></ol></p>

<h3>The classical guitar (Spanish guitar/nylon-string guitar).</h3>
<p>The classical guitar (also known as the nylon-string guitar or Spanish guitar) is used in classical music and other styles. In the nineteenth century, a Spanish luthier, <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_de_Torres_Jurado">Antonio de Torres Jurado</a>, created the modern classical guitar that we use today. Spanish guitar is strung with nylon, rather than metal strings, its neck is under considerably less tension than that of an acoustic guitar. A Spanish guitar neck therefore does not require a truss rod, and is constructed from a solid piece of wood. A classical Spanish Guitar called Flamenco guitar, similar to a classical guitar but commonly found in Spain and Latin America.<br>
<br>Acoustic guitars and electric guitars use steel strings, whereas classical guitars use nylon strings. The large scale in the Spanish guitar has several versions; the most common has a measurement of 664 mm. and 660 mm. It is important to notice that even though 1 centimeter or 1.4 centimeter might seem a slight difference, it is very important when playing. They produce a gentle, mellow sound which is often found in jazz and Latin music.<br> 
<br>As opposed to steel strings which are hard on the fingers, nylon strings are soft and gentle on the fingers, making them a preferred choice for beginners.</p>

<h3>The steel-string acoustic guitar or electric guitar</h3>
<p>The steel-string acoustic guitar is a modern form of guitar that descends from the gut-strung Romantic guitar, but is strung with steel strings for a brighter, louder sound. It was around 1936 when a jazz guitarist named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Christian">Charlie Christian</a> (1916-1942) began using an acoustic guitar with a pickup attached to the body, with the intention of playing guitar solos in his band. This is said to be the birth of the electric guitar. Like the modern classical guitar, it is often referred to simply as an acoustic guitar, or sometimes as a folk guitar.<br> 
<br>Acoustic guitars are available with either steel strings or nylon strings. Guitars with nylon strings are often referred to as classical guitars. Here are some of the main differences between the two different types of guitar. Sometimes called 80/20 bronze strings, they have a treble-laden and cutting tone. Because of this, they work best on big acoustic guitars which can counter-balance them with bass. These guitars include dreadnought guitars, jumbo guitars, and OM guitars.<br> 
<br>Steel and nickel are mainly used to make guitar strings for electric guitars. Usually, an electric guitar string will consist of a steel wire that is plated in nickel, although you can also buy strings that are made from pure steel or pure nickel, which have both become a popular choice in recent years.
Most popular music, like rock, bluegrass and country, is played on steel-string guitars because of the strings' crisp, bright tone. They simply offer more volume and power. Meanwhile, nylon-string guitars are used most often for the sweeping sounds of classical, jazz and bossa nova because of their lighter attack. Even so, a seldom-played guitar will quickly acquire rusted strings because of humidity and moisture in the air. The average set of strings played by the average player may last around 90 days (about three months).</p>

<h3>The Hawaiian guitar</h3> 
<p>The lap steel guitar, also known as a Hawaiian guitar, is a type of steel guitar without pedals that is typically played with the instrument in a horizontal position across the performer's lap. Popularized by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Kekuku">JOSEPH KEKUKU</a>.<br> 
The most familiar Hawaiian instrument is the 'ukulele, a small type of guitar. The instrument was probably introduced to Hawai'i in 1879 by Portuguese settlers from Madeira who brought with them a small guitar called the braguinha.<br>
<br><b>Why is it called Hawaiian guitar?</b><br>
It originated in the Hawaiian Islands about 1885, popularized by an Oahu youth named Joseph Kekuku, who became known for playing a traditional guitar by laying it across his lap and sliding a piece of metal against the strings to change the pitch. The Hawaiians began playing a conventional guitar in a horizontal position across the knees instead of flat against the body, using the bar instead of fingers. Joseph Kekuku developed this manner of playing a guitar, known as "Hawaiian style", about 1890 and the technique spread internationally. Hawaiian guitar have  eight strings.<br>
Years ago most of the steel guitars just had six strings, but today most have eight strings, and some like ours have double necks with eight strings each.

<p><center><figcaption>BASS GUITAR</figcaption></center></p>
<p><b>About:-</b>
A bass guitar is a plucked string instrument built in the style of an electric guitar but producing lower frequencies. It produces sound when its metal bass strings vibrate over one or more magnetic pickups (although non-magnetic pickups are occasionally used as well). The pickups then transmit a signal, via instrument cable, into an amplifier, which allows the bass to be heard at a wide range of volumes.<br>
There are many famous bassists throughout the history of music including:
<ol type="I"><li>Paul McCartney</li>
<li>Bootsy Collins</li>
<li>Mike Watt</li>
<li>The Bandâ€™s Rick Danko</li>
<li>Paul Jackson</li></ol>

<p><center><figcaption>ACOUSTIC GUITAR</figcaption></center></p>
<p><b>About:-</b>
An acoustic guitar is a musical instrument in the string family. When a string is plucked, its vibration is transmitted from the bridge, resonating throughout the top of the guitar. It is also transmitted to the side and back of the instrument, resonating through the air in the body, and producing sound from the sound hole.
Some of the most important varieties are:
<ol type="I"><li>The classical guitar (Spanish Guitar/Nylon-stringed)</li>
<li>Steel-string acoustic guitar</li>
<li>Lap steel guitar</li></ol></p>

<p><center><figcaption>ELECTRIC GUITAR</figcaption></center></p>
<p><b>About:-</b>
An electric guitar is a guitar that requires external amplification in order to be heard at typical performance volumes, unlike a standard acoustic guitar. It uses one or more pickups to convert the vibration of its strings into electrical signals, which ultimately are reproduced as sound by loudspeakers. The sound is sometimes shaped or electronically altered to achieve different timbres or tonal qualities from that of an acoustic guitar via amplifier settings or knobs on the guitar. </p>
