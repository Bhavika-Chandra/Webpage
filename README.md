# Guitar webpage
My first basic project on web development (which I created to gain some practical experience of front-end web development).
In this project I have mentioned the details of "Guitars" and its various types.
The styling of UI is such that the readers feel more indulged in reading and visualizing things better!
There is an icon bar on top and a nav-bar on the leftmost side of the page. (I have to work more on them to make the page dynamic and more user-interactive.) 
Also, I have added "viewport" element, so that users do not feel difficulty adjusting on their phone,tablet screens.
There is an icon also (a guitar icon) beside the title of this webpage.

*I have styled the page in a best possible way!*
